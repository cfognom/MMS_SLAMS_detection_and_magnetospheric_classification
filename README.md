# MMS SLAMS detection and magnetospheric classification

This repository holds the matlab implementation of the SLAMS detection- and magnetospheric classification algorithm of my master thesis. Consider reading it to get a better understanding of this repsitory.

# Prerequisites
* Matlab R2019b
* The IRFU-Matlab package on your Matlab path, available at https://github.com/irfu/irfu-matlab (Cloned on 21 Feb 2020)  
Newer versions of Matlab and the IRFU package will probably work too. **Please note** that you do not need any of this if you are just interested in the raw SLAMS database.
