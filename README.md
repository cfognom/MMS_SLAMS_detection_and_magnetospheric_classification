# MMS SLAMS detection and magnetospheric classification

This repository holds the matlab implementation of the SLAMS detection- and magnetospheric classification algorithm that was developed as part of my master thesis. Consider reading it to get a better understanding of this repsitory. It is available here: https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1498858&dswid=-5630

## Acronyms
Short large-amplitude magnetic structure(s) (SLAMS)

Magnetospheric multiscale (MMS)

## Prerequisites
* Matlab R2019b
* The IRFU-Matlab package on your Matlab path, available at https://github.com/irfu/irfu-matlab (Cloned on 21 Feb 2020)
* A local MMS database with fpi, fgm and mec data

Newer versions of Matlab and the IRFU package will probably work too. **Please note** that you do not need any of this if you are just interested in the raw SLAMS database. This is only if you want to continue development, create a new SLAMS database with other settings or use the database loader: [load_SLAMS.m](load_SLAMS.m).

## File structure

1. [**SLAMS_database/**](SLAMS_database) Holds the SLAMS database and is the default directory for new databases.

2. [**cache/**](cache) Some intermediate data is cached here to avoid time consuming recalculations.

3. [**events/**](events) Contains csv-files with ``sitl``- and ``burst_segment``-data about SLAMS and the quasi-parallel bowshock from the MMS science data center. It was used to find suitable intervals for the validation dataset.

4. [**labeled/**](labeled) Holds the manually created validation dataset in two folders: [data/](labeled/data) and [plot/](labeled/plot). [data/](labeled/data) contains txt-files (one file for each validation interval) with alternating SLAMS start- and stop time data. Each file is named according to this naming convention: ``[id]_[interval start time]_[interval stop time].txt`` (time is specified as nanoseconds since 2000). [plot/](labeled/plot) contains images of the intervals where SLAMS are marked for reference.

5. [**tools/**](tools) This is essentially a toolbox that holds many useful functions.

6. [**SLAMS_analysis.m**](SLAMS_analysis.m) The function used to investigate SLAMS propteries (Section 3.6 and 4.2 of the thesis). Requires a SLAMS-database struct as input, which can be produced by [load_SLAMS.m](load_SLAMS.m).

7. [**SLAMS_finder.m**](SLAMS_finder.m) The main file which holds the ``SLAMS_finder``-class. The class implements both the SLAMS finder algorithm and the magnetospheric classifier. To find SLAMS, first initialize the class, then run the ``evaluate`` method and provide a time interval. ``evaluate`` then outputs a struct of SLAMS. Usage example can be found in [find_SLAMS.m](find_SLAMS.m).

8. [**SLAMS_marker.m**](SLAMS_marker.m) Contains the code used to manually mark SLAMS to create the validation dataset.

9. [**SLAMS_results.m**](SLAMS_results.m) The function used to produce the results in section 4.2 of the thesis. Requires a SLAMS-database struct as input, which can be produced by [load_SLAMS.m](load_SLAMS.m).

10. [**find_SLAMS.m**](find_SLAMS.m) This code can produce new SLAMS-databases by searcing multiple intervals.

11. [**load_SLAMS.m**](load_SLAMS.m) A function that takes the name of a SLAMS-database (the name of the folder where the database is located) and loads it into a struct.

12. [**validate_SLAMS_finder.m**](validate_SLAMS_finder.m) The code used to validate the SLAMS detection algorithm against the validation dataset (section 3.2 of the thesis).

## SLAMS database structure

A SLAMS database consists of at most 5 files. We provide only one SLAMS database here: [identified_SLAMS_mms1_median60](SLAMS_database/identified_SLAMS_mms1_median60). It was created using a moving median of 60 seconds as the background field estimator (more information about this choice can be found in the thesis). If you want other settings, you can create a new database with [find_SLAMS.m](find_SLAMS.m).

1. [**database_info.txt**](SLAMS_database/identified_SLAMS_mms1_median60/database_info.txt) Contains the settings for the ``SLAMS_finder``-class and other meta-information.

2. [**search_durations_primary.txt**](SLAMS_database/identified_SLAMS_mms1_median60/search_durations_primary.txt) and [**search_durations_secondary.txt**](SLAMS_database/identified_SLAMS_mms1_median60/search_durations_secondary.txt) Contains data about how many seconds were spent inside each sector and magnetospheric class. The format of this data is shown on page 33 of the thesis.

3. [**SLAMS_primary.csv**](SLAMS_database/identified_SLAMS_mms1_median60/SLAMS_primary.csv) and [**SLAMS_secondary.csv**](SLAMS_database/identified_SLAMS_mms1_median60/SLAMS_secondary.csv) These files contains the identified SLAMS in csv-format. The contents of each column is explained by the file header, but it should also be mentioned that all positional data is in [km] (GSE) and B-field data is in [nT]. As explained in the thesis, *primary* and *secondary*, is when the fpi-instrument is active or inactive respectively. As such, primary SLAMS has additional information about their magnetospheric location.
